# Python-Course: Basic Calculator Program- Week 1
Basic Calculator Program
Overview
The Basic Calculator Program is a simple Python script that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program takes user inputs for two numbers and an operation, then computes and displays the result.

Features
Perform basic arithmetic operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Input validation for division by zero.
User-friendly prompts and clear output messages.
How to Use
Run the program using a Python interpreter (Python 3 or higher is recommended).
Follow the prompts:
Enter the first number.
Enter the second number.
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
The program will calculate and display the result of the chosen operation.


**My list-Week 2**
Python List Manipulation Assignment
Description
This Python program demonstrates the use of various list methods and operations. The program starts with creating an empty list, then performs the following operations:

Appends values to the list.
Inserts a value at a specific position.
Extends the list with another list.
Removes the last element from the list.
Sorts the list in ascending order.
Finds and prints the index of a specific value.
Tasks Performed
Create an empty list: Initializes an empty list called my_list.
Append elements: Adds the values 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list using append().
Insert a value at the second position: Inserts 15 at the second position (index 1) using insert().
Extend the list: Adds a new list [50, 60, 70] to my_list using extend().
Remove the last element: Removes the last element of the list using pop().
Sort the list: Sorts my_list in ascending order using sort().
After performing all the above operations, the program finds and prints the index of the value 30 in the updated list.
